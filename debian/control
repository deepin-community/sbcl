Description: Common Lisp compiler and development system
 SBCL is a development environment for the ANSI Common Lisp language.
 It provides a native-code compiler and an integrated debugger, as well
 as all the features in the ANSI specification.
 .
 SBCL also contains other extensions to the ANSI specification, including
 a foreign-function interface, a pseudo-server API, user-extensible
 stream functionality, a Meta-Object Protocol, and an ability to run
 external processes.
 .
 To browse SBCL source definitions with development environments,
 install the sbcl-source package. For documentation on SBCL's usage
 and internals, the package sbcl-doc is provided.

Description: Documentation for Steel Bank Common Lisp
 This package provides documentation for SBCL -- a development
 environment for the ANSI Common Lisp language.
 .
 The documents in this package cover SBCL-specific extensions to the
 language, explain how to use this Common Lisp implementation and how
 it differs from the ANSI standard.
 .
 The manual about SBCL's internals is also included in this package
 and may be of interest for people who intent to work with SBCL's
 source code.

Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Source code files for SBCL
 This package provides the source code for SBCL -- a development
 environment for the ANSI Common Lisp language.
 .
 The source code is useful in conjunction with development
 environments and debuggers like SLIME, that allow macro expansion and
 lookup of source definitions.
 .
 Installing this package enables your source browser to dig deeply
 into the core of Steel Bank Common Lisp.
