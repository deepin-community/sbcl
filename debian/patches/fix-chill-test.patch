Description: Fix chill.test.sh in the Debian-specific context
 chill.test.sh loads src/cold/chill.lisp, which itself loads
 src/compiler/vop-existsp.lisp, but using the SYS logical pathname host.
 This fails at build time because debian/rules has initialized the SYS logical
 host to /usr/share/sbcl-source/ in the Lisp image (and this will also break
 in the autopkgtest because the sbcl-source package is not installed there).
 .
 This patch therefore switches back the SYS logical host to the current build
 directory.
